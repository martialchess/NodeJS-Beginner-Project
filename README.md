## Challenges Overcome

### **1. Windows-Specific Issues**
- **MongoDB Package Conflicts**: Windows Defender flagged `update.js` causing installation failures. Solution: Added folder exclusions and downgraded to compatible version.
- **File Path Handling**: Windows backslash vs Unix forward slash issues in file paths. Solution: Used `path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Filename Validation**: `toISOString()` colons invalid in Windows filenames. Solution: Replaced colons with hyphens using regex.

### **2. Mongoose Version Updates**
- **Deprecated `.execPopulate()`**: Upgraded from Mongoose 5.x to 6.x patterns where `.populate()` returns promises directly.
- **Schema Validation**: Implemented proper error handling for missing required fields.

### **3. Authentication Flow**
- **Session vs Request Data**: Understanding when to use `req.session.user` vs `req.user` and proper middleware ordering.
- **Password Reset Logic**: Implementing secure token generation, expiration, and validation flow.

### **4. Email Integration**
- **SendGrid Setup**: Navigated sender verification requirements and API key management.
- **Error Handling**: Made email sending non-blocking to prevent app crashes during development.

### **5. Stripe Payment Integration**
- **API Updates**: Adapted to Stripe's newer checkout session structure with `price_data` instead of deprecated SKU patterns.
- **Environment Variables**: Properly accessing `process.env` values (not string literals!).

### **6. File Upload & Management**
- **Multer Configuration**: Proper storage configuration with unique filenames.
- **File Cleanup**: Implementing helper functions to delete old images when products are updated/deleted.
- **Authorization**: Ensuring users can only download invoices for their own orders.

### **7. Validation & Error Handling**
- **DRY Principle**: Refactored duplicate error rendering code into reusable helper functions.
- **express-validator Compatibility**: Handled `e.param` vs `e.path` differences across versions.
- **Defensive Programming**: Added checks for undefined session states in error handlers.
